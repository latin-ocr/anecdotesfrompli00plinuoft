ENGLISH EXERCISES

As these exercises are closely connected with the divisions
of the Latin text of the same number, continual reference
should be made to the corresponding pic-ce of Latin, as
similar constructions will be frequently round in both, and
some assistance may be gained by comparing the two. The
sections in the rules at the head of the exercises refer to
Allen’s Latin Grammar. The rules must in all cases be learnt
thoroughly preparatory to attempting the exercises. Words
linked by hyphens are to be translated by a single Latin
word. (The exercises are divided into classes A. B ; Α being
easier, B slightly harder.)
