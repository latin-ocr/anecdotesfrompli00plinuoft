CAECILIUS SEcerzs.

CAms PLmIUs CAECILIUS SECUNDUS was born at
Novum Comum, the modern Come», towards the end of
A.D. 61 or about the beginning of Aa», 62. Both his
father and mother were of good birth, and his uncle, the
elder Pliny, was of equestrian rank. His father died
A. D. 76 and Pliny, who was not yet of age, was left to
the care of his uncle. His uncle was a most laborious and
industrious writer and no doubt his example had a deep
influence on Pliny, but he died only three years later in
the great eruption of Vesuvius, ΑΛ). 79, which caused
such widespread devastation and buried Pompeii and
Herculaneum. The younger Pliny certainly inherited his
industry and somewhat ostentatiously imitated his habit
of utilizing every moment of the day.

The death of the elder Pliny, who had adopted his
nephew and made him his heir, placed the young man in
possession os a considerable fortune. While still con-

’ tinuing his literary studies (he had composed a Greek

tragedy when barely fourteen years old), he determined
to follow the ordinary senatorial career. W'hen nineteen
he began to speak‚ not without some success, at thobar
and he held various minor offices in the state with duties
corresponding to those of a justice of the peace, and also
he spent six months with a legion as military tribune, the
usual course preliminary to entering on a public career.
