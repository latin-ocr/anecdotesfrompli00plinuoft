PREFACE

Tms book is intended for forms that have made
a little progress in Latin and have reached a stage
in advance of Latin Readers and elementary, dis-
connected storieS.

The early parts of the Anecdotes are simple and
the constructions remain fairly easy even When the
sentences begin to lengthen‚ but it is hoped that,
by the aid of full punctuation. boys may soon
become accustomed to face the longer sentences
with confidence. ·

The editor trusts that the ease of the constructions
will equalize the difficulties of a large vocabulary:
a large vocabulary in selections from such a writer
as Pliny is unavoidable‚ if the colour of the
original is in any way to be retained.

As in former books of this series, there is a special
vocabulary of proper names to facilitate speedy
reference and to leave no loophole of excuse for
{ffinossntoe {1315 Ρῗτεοέξ and plasses ffigntkiloned· in

based to a certain extent on the text : of these there
are two grades, with easier and more advanced
exampleS.

As in the other Readers of the same series, con-
tinual reference is made in the notes to the very
useful and comprehensive Clarendon Press Elemen-
tary Latin Grammar by Mr. Allen.
